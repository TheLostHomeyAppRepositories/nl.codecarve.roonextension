## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-28

### Summary

Cumulative release combining speaker grouping functionality from v1.1.13 and stability improvements from v1.1.14.

### Added

- **Flow Actions for Output Grouping:**

## [1.1.11] - 2025-07-27

### Added

- Full Homey speaker device class integration with standard speaker capabilities
- Standard media control capabilities: `speaker_playing`, `speaker_next`, `speaker_prev`, `speaker_shuffle`, `speaker_repeat`, `speaker_position`
- Standard volume control capabilities: `volume_up`, `volume_down`, `volume_mute`
- Direct volume setting capability: `volume_set` (outputs only)
- Volume soft limit control capability: `volume_soft_limit` (outputs only)
- Queue information capabilities: `speaker_queue_items_remaining` and `speaker_queue_time_remaining` (both device types)
- Multilingual support: Added Spanish, French, and German translations (5 languages total)
- New "Turn Off All Outputs" flow action that puts all audio outputs into standby mode one by one
- This action processes outputs sequentially with a small delay between each to avoid overwhelming the system

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where Roon Radio, shuffle, and repeat actions on outputs would affect the wrong zone
- Output devices now correctly use zone_id instead of output_id for `change_settings` API calls

### Enhanced

- Roon devices now integrate seamlessly with Homey's speaker ecosystem
- "Turn off all speakers" zone commands now include Roon devices
- Google Assistant and Alexa voice commands recognize Roon devices as speakers
- Standard Homey media controls work with Roon devices
- Flow cards for "all speakers" automatically include Roon devices
- Full internationalization with translations for app name, tagline, device names, and all UI elements

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where output action cards were controlling the wrong outputs due to flow actions being registered at device level instead of driver level
- Added transport availability checks to prevent execution on missing transport objects in flow actions
- Prevented driver crashes when transport object is unavailable
- Moved all flow action registrations from device.js to driver.js for both roon-output and roon-zone drivers
- Flow actions now properly use args.device parameter to target the correct device instance

### Removed

- Removed `convenience_switch` capability and associated flow action from roon-output devices

### Technical Details

- Updated `.homeycompose/app.json` to include all standard speaker capabilities
- Enhanced capability listeners in both roon-output and roon-zone device implementations
- Added `onCapabilityVolumeSoftLimit` method for volume limit control
